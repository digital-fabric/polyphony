## What is Polyphony?

Polyphony is a library for building concurrent applications in Ruby. Polyphony
harnesses the power of [Ruby fibers](https://rubyapi.org/3.3/o/fiber) to provide
a cooperative, sequential coroutine-based concurrency model. Under the hood,
Polyphony uses [io_uring](https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html) or
[libev](https://github.com/enki/libev) to maximize I/O performance.

## Features

* Ruby fibers as the main unit of concurrency.
* [Structured concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency)
  coupled with robust exception handling.
* Message passing between fibers, even across threads!
* High-performance I/O using the core Ruby I/O classes and
  [io_uring](https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html) with support for
  [advanced I/O patterns](docs/advanced-io.md).
